# Moving-Average-Model

Moving average process
In a moving average (MA) process, the current value depends linearly on the mean of
the series, the current error term, and past error terms.
The moving average model is denoted as MA(q), where q is the order. The general
expression of an MA(q) model is

yt = µ + ϵt + θ1ϵt–1 + θ2ϵt–2 +⋅⋅⋅+ θqϵt–q
